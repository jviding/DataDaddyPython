radar - no ID
seen  - ID given, who saw and who!

hit - ENEMY ID GIVEN!! also own ID
die - both IDs given
detected - ID of who has been detected


1. start - radar

	a. if more than 1 targets radared the same time?

		- save all locations

	b. start attacking one
		1. if miss, scan one of the three possibilities
		2. if hit, scan one of the shot spots and scan 2 random places

2. enemy found - attack

	a. how to keep the target???

3. enemy destroyed

	a. check all detected!

	b. all scan separate targets that's been seen before

4. if found, return to step 2.

5. if not found, return to step 1.



Our ship detected/seen/hit

1. Evade always at least 2 times after the last time been seen
	a. if Evades ok. No hits/detects. Go back to other tasks.
	
	b. else if we see someone while evading
		1. Restart evade, Store bot seen to our known targets

	c. else we are still targeted by something, restart evade move

	d. (Maybe if 1v1 situation and known attacker, let's not give a fuck and just attack back)
		Here if we have a lot of HP might be good to just attack instead of evade.
		Although, evade gives us always a chance to escape!
